  "description": "Longinus is a pure-Swift high-performance asynchronous web image loading and caching framework.\n\n* Asynchronous image downloading and caching.\n* Preload images and cache them to disk for further showing.\n* Animated GIF support (dynamic buffer, lower memory usage).\n* Baseline/progressive/interlaced image decode support.\n* View extensions for UIImageView, UIButton, MKAnnotationView and CALayer to directly set an image from a URL.\n* Image loading category for UIImageView, UIButton and CALayer.\n* Built-in transition animation when setting images.(or you can set your custom image showing transion)\n* Image Transform after downloading supported: blur, round corner, resize, color tint, crop, rotate and more.\n* High performance memory and disk image cache. Use LRU algorithm to manage. For disk cache, it use file system and sqlite for better performance.\n* Use FIFO queue to handle image downloading operation.\n* Smooth sliding without UI lags. High performance image caching and decoding to avoid main thread blocked.",
